# Blendr (not a hook up app)
This prototype visualizes CSS background blend modes (sorry Edge/IE users).  
- [Live Demo](https://acidtone.github.io/blendr)

## Project Status
This is a work in progress. It started as an excuse to play with CSS variables and may be ported to Vue in the near-ish future.

## Backlog
- Ability to upload custom image
- HSLA settings reset button
- Move HSLA form inputs to side panel
- One-click CSS export for 
  - `background-blend-mode`
  - `mix-blend-mode`
  - `hsla()`, `rgba()` or hex
